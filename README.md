1. The CNN net is proposed by Gil Levi et al. (see https://github.com/GilLevi/AgeGenderDeepLearning/blob/master)

2. The net is trained by two datasets, which include: (a),faces from Wiki (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)
and (b), faces captured by surveillance video.

3. Folder 'image' contains 100 images tested by the network, and the predicted results are stored in folder ‘results’.
